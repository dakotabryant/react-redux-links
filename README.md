# React/Redux Links
Curated tutorial and resource links I've collected on React, Redux, ES6, and more, meant to be a collection of high-quality articles and resources for someone who wants to learn about the React-Redux ecosystem, as well as a source for quality information on advanced topics and techniques.  Not quite "awesome", but hopefully useful as a starting point I can give to others.  Suggestions welcome.

Another important resource is the **Reactiflux community on Discord**, which has chat channels dedicated to discussion of React, Redux, and other related technologies.  There's always a number of people hanging out and answering questions, and it's a great place to ask questions and learn.  The invite link is at **https://www.reactiflux.com**.

You might also want to check out my categorized list of Redux-related addons, libraries, and utilities, at [Redux Ecosystem Links](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links).  Also see [Community Resources](community-resources.md) for links to other links lists, podcasts, and email newsletters.  Finally, I also keep a dev blog at [blog.isquaredsoftware.com](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com), where I write about React, Redux, Webpack, and more.
